    title: "Medical Camp Management System (MCMS)",
    description:
      "Developed a MERN stack platform to streamline the organization and participation of medical camps. The system allows organizers to create and manage camps, track participant registrations, confirm payments, and view feedback. Participants can browse available camps, register through a secure modal form, complete payments via Stripe, and access personalized dashboards with analytics. The app is responsive across devices, uses JWT for authentication, and leverages TanStack Query for efficient data fetching. A key focus was delivering a smooth user experience with real-time participant counts, search/sort functionality, and clear role-based dashboards.",
